# Water Half Torpedo Half (물 반 어뢰 반)

## Introduction

You must avoid approaching torpedoes. There are many games of this genre. However, there is a distinction only in this game: The enemy's information is given **discontinuously**. You can only verify the position of the torpedo when the radar is passing by. It will allows you to experience that what is natural is not natural.
